How to use GitHub to synchronize just my Atom Vocola voice commands commands:

- If NaturallySpeaking is running, shut it down

- Rename your current Vocola voice command folder
- Create a new version of the Vocola voice command folder

- Use the GitHub shell to go to the Vocola voice command folder

- Run the following command, which clones the repo into this folder (if the folder is empty)
git clone https://github.com/aschneiderman/atom-voice-vocola .


- Move all of your Vocola voice command files back into this folder

- Make a small change to atom.vcl, then synchronize it using GitHub for Windows.
Check in GitHub to make sure that only atom.vcl was synchronized – no other .vcl files should be in the GitHub site
