TROUBLESHOOTING

If I edit files on one computer, synchronize with GitHub, but then the changes don't show up on
GitHub for Windows on another computer, try the following:

- Open GitHub for Windows and click on the repository

- Click on the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner, and choose Open in Git Shell.
	This will open up a PowerShell with Git ready to go inside the repository's current branch.
- Type:
	git pull
	You should see the names of the files that are synchronized.
